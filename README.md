# My Résumé

Hi, I'm Ryan McGowan and this is my résumé.

It is in Latex so you may compile it however you want. I like to use
`pdflatex`. To use my default `pdflatex` command just run make or look at the
`genpdf` task in the
[Makefile](https://github.com/RyanMcG/personal-resume/blob/master/Makefile).

    $ make

If you have `watchr` installed (`gem install watchr`) you can edit the
[resume.tex](https://github.com/RyanMcG/personal-resume/blob/master/resume.tex)
file and get and generate a new pdf when the file is saved.

    $ make watch

That's all folks!
