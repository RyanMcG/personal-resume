# My Résumé

Hi, I'm Ryan McGowan and this is my résumé.

It is in Latex so you may compile it however you want. I like to use
`pdflatex`.

    $ pdflatex resume.tex

If you have `watchr` installed (`gem install watchr`) you can edit the
resume.tex file and get and generate a new pdf when the file is saved.

    $ watchr watchr_res.rb

Maybe I'll make a web friendly version of this someday. . .
