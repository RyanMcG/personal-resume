I am very excited about this opportunity. Amazon is very interesting company to me (for many reasons, but especially EC2).  I have a strong interest in web development and design including both the front-end and the back-end. I find systems administration very interesting as well.  For these reasons, I know there is a place you can use me.  I'm a fast learner and I would love to gain some experience working for one of the more interesting companies on the web today.  Please checkout my Resume.  Besides web technologies I would also be interested in software development (especially with Java). I have experience with Java in academia, but haven't gotten to apply it in the real world yet.
